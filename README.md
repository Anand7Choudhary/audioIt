## Introduction

Text summarization is a method that presents a condensed version of one or more texts with semantics (Gupta & Lehal, 2010), while audio summarization offers audiences the convenience of listening to an audio summary rather than reading a text summary (Vartakavi et al., 2021). In this project, we focus on audio-to-audio summarization using mp3 audio as inputs to summarize the content into shorter versions while not losing much emotion information. Our primary objective is to identify the best-performing model for audio-to-audio summarization among the models we have explored. This technique will potentially enhance business efficiency and broaden accessibility, benefiting diverse audiences such as individuals with visual impairments, thereby making it applicable for daily use across various scenarios.
